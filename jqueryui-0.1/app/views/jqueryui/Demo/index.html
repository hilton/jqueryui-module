#{extends 'jqueryui/layout.html'/}

<p>This module provides working examples of <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> widgets, integrated with a Play appliction.</p>

<p>This is not a Play module in the normal sense, providing additional server-side functionality that your application will directly depend on.
Instead, this module provides re-usable view template and JavaScript snippets that you can use, as well us sample controller actions for the server-side parts.</p>

<h2>jQuery UI widgets</h2>

<p>This module includes code samples for several widgets.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="@{jqueryui.Accordion.index()}">Accordion</a>
		- collapsible content sections that are loaded via Ajax when opened.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="@{jqueryui.Autocomplete.index()}">Autocomplete</a>
		- Ajax suggest-while-you-type for form controls.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="@{jqueryui.DatePicker.index()}">Date picker</a>
		- date selector pop-up that uses the application date format and language.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="@{jqueryui.Dialog.index()}">Dialog</a>
		- dialogue box that can be used as a selector pop-up for form values.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="@{jqueryui.Progressbar.index()}">Progressbar</a>
		- progress indicator that uses web sockets to report a jobâ€™s completion percentage.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="@{jqueryui.Tabs.index()}">Tabs</a>
		- content sections that are loaded via Ajax when selected.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, each widget requires several separate code snippets:</p>

<ol>
<li>A view template that contains static undecorated HTML.</li>
<li>A JavaScript file that uses jQuery to apply the widget to the HTML.</li>
<li>A controller action that handles Ajax requests from the widget, and either renders an template or directly generates a JSON response.</li>
<li>A template for the Ajax response, in the case that the controller renders one.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these sections of code is usually very small; you just have to know how to wire them together.</p>

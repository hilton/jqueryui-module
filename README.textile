h2. Integrate jQuery UI widgets with your Play application

The jQuery UI module provides working examples of "jQuery UI":http://jqueryui.com/ widgets, integrated with a Play appliction.

This module includes code samples for several widgets:

* Accordion - collapsible content sections that are loaded via Ajax when opened.
* Autocomplete - Ajax suggest-while-you-type for form controls.
* Date picker - date selector pop-up that uses the application date format and language.
* Dialog - dialogue box that can be used as a selector pop-up for form values.
* Progressbar - progress indicator that uses web sockets to report a jobâ€™s completion percentage.
* Tabs - content sections that are loaded via Ajax when selected.

This is not a Play module in the normal sense, providing additional server-side functionality that your application will directly depend on. Instead, this module provides re-usable view template and JavaScript snippets that you can use, as well us sample controller actions for the server-side parts.

h2. Getting started.

Download the module and run it as a Play application, to browse the examples:

bc. git clone https://github.com/hilton/jqueryui-module.git
play run jqueryui-module

Documentation is included as views in the module itself, referencing the code. Follow the usage instrutions below to access the documentation.
